# hello-world-DevOps-Project
This project contains the source code of Java application along with several other files which I have used to set up complete CI/CD pipeline using several DevOps tools. 
I have used Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Docker, DockerHub and Kubernetes to deploy the application at last. I have used EKS service of AWS in order to create cluster of Kubernetes.
